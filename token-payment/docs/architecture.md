# vbwd-android-token-payment — architecture

Port of the iOS `token payment` plugin. Plugin id `token-payment`,
version `1.0.0`.

## Boundary

This module depends on **`:core` only**. The
build's `dependencyBoundaryCheck` task enforces that boundary; an undeclared
edge to another plugin (or to `:app`) fails the build. The plugin is a thin
**composition root**: `Plugin.install(sdk)` wires the domain (services/stores),
the Compose views, and the menu items — each in its own file (Single
Responsibility).

## Extension seams used

Pay an order from the token balance — instant, no redirect.

Concretely it registers: the `token_balance` payment action + a PaymentMethodToken_balance section, translations — all via the `PlatformSdk` facade, never by
reaching into a registry or the host's composition root (Interface Segregation /
Dependency Inversion).

## Lifecycle

`install` (register seams) → `activate` (mark live) → `deactivate` / `uninstall`
(tear down — unsubscribe events, release stores). A failure in any hook is
**isolated** by the host's `PluginRegistry`: this plugin becomes
`PluginStatus.Error` without aborting its peers.
